function filled_series = interpseries(series)
% INTERPOLATION to fill gaps in a timeseries. It should fill all NaN's with
% an interpolated value. This can be usefull for running mean and
% variance calculations.
%
% Interpolates over NaNs (data gaps) in the input time series (may be
% complex) using interp1 function. If there are leading or trailing NaN's
% in the series, they are set to the mean of the entire dataset.
%
% WARNING: If series contains only NaN's, interp1 throws an error, so this
% function simply returns the original series of NaN's if this is the case.
