\caption{Multiple regression results for three dependent variables. Mean below-snow T\textsubscript{soil} and winter quarter θ were regressed against principal component scores from the below-snow PCA, and mean summer quarter θ was regressed against scores from the warm season PCA (see Appendix for PC axis details). Each multiple regression model was tested using data from all years together and data from each of three individual years. Regression coefficients for each PC axis and asterisks denoting their significance as explanatory variables in the model (*** for p < 0.001; ** for p < 0.01; * for p < 0.05) are shown.\label{regression_pca_t}}
