\caption{Summarized results for linear regression of mean summer quarter Î¸ on a number of explanatory variables. Results from 5 cm, 20 cm, and 50 cm soil depths are shown (n = 252 sites). Negative regression coefficients are indicated in parentheses, all others were positive. For each variable, numbers represent the total number of sites in which simple linear regression was significant (p < 0.05). Asterisks denote the level of significance of the explanatory variable in a multi-level linear model using site as the random variable (*** for p < 0.001; ** for p < 0.01; * for p < 0.05).\label{regression_warm_t}}
